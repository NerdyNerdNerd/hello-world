# hello-world
Github training repo

The hello world program is the first program that everyone learning programming usually starts out with.
it is the easiest thing to program and lets the programmer know that his/her "child" is alive in the computer.
I am a Computer Science Major who is looking to get started using Github and see where it takes me.
